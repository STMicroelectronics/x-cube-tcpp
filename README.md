## __Description__

**X-CUBE-TCPP** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative. It uses for USB Type-C and Power Delivery software expansion for STM32Cube
([UM2285](https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/dm00432311-development-guidelines-for-stm32cube-expansion-packages-stmicroelectronics.pdf)).

**X-CUBE-TCPP** is a USB-IF certified Expansion Package (**USB Type-C Rev 2.0 and Power Delivery 3.1**) and consists of libraries, drivers, sources, APIs and application examples
running on STM32 Series GP microcontrollers embedding Type-C and power delivery management (thanks to the embedded UCPD PHY integrated in STM32G4, STM32G0, STM32L5 and STM32U5).

For the other STM32 GP MCU without embedded UCPD PHY (like STM32L4, STM32F0...), this package demonstrates how to comply with Type-C specification.

All the applications available in this package need to have either the [TCPP01-M12](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp01-m12.html), the [TCPP02-M18](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp02-m18.html) or the [TCPP03-M20](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp03-m20.html) integrated.

The [TCPP01-M12](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp01-m12.html) (Type-C port protection) is a single chip solution for USB Type-C port protection that facilitates the migration from USB legacy connectors type-A or type-B to USB Type-C connectors.

The [TCPP02-M18](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp02-m18.html) (Type-C port protection) is a single chip solution for USB Type-C port protection in the context of Source applications.

The [TCPP03-M20](https://www.st.com/en/protection-devices/tcpp03-m20.html) (Type-C port protection) is a single chip solution for USB Type-C port protection in the context of Dual Role Power applications.

**STMicroelectronics package has been certified by USB-IF through the reference [TID 5205](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/42552), [TID 6408](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/43767), [TID 3036](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/40004), [TID 7884](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/45433) and [TID 8088](https://cms.usb.org/usb/cms/device/45710).**

## __How to use__

This repository has been created using the `git submodule` command. Please check the instructions below for proper use. Please check also **the notes at the end of this section** for further information.

1. To **clone** this repository along with the linked submodules, option `--recursive` has to be specified as shown below.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-tcpp.git
```

2. To get the **latest updates**, in case this repository is **already** on your local machine, issue the following **two** commands (with this repository as the **current working directory**).

```bash
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. To use the **same package version** as the one available on [st.com](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-tcpp.html), issue the command below **after** specifying the targeted `vX.Y.Z` version. This should be done **after** the command(s) indicated in instruction (1) or in instruction (2) above have been successfully executed.

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z # Specify the targeted vX.Y.Z version
```

4. To **avoid** going through the above instructions and **directly** clone the same firmware version as the one available on [st.com](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-tcpp.html), issue the command below **after** specifying the targeted `vX.Y.Z` version.

```bash
git clone --recursive  --depth 1 --branch vX.Y.Z https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-tcpp.git
```

> [!NOTE]
> * The latest version of this firmware available on GitHub may be **ahead** of the one available on [st.com](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-tcpp.html) or via [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). This is due to the **rolling release** process deployed on GitHub. Please refer to [this](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube_MCU_Overall_Offer/discussions/21) post for more details.
> * Option `--depth 1` specified in instruction (4) above is **not** mandatory. It may be useful to skip downloading all previous commits up to the one corresponding to the targeted version.
> * If GitHub "Download ZIP" option is used instead of the `git clone` command, then the different submodules have to be collected and added **manually**.
